# HandlerSocket

Haskell implementation of a client for the [HandlerSocket Plugin for MySQL](https://github.com/ahiguti/HandlerSocket-Plugin-for-MySQL).
This is very much work in progress.

## TODO

* a monadic interface would be nice
* different types for rw / ro connections
  * it's not possible to discover this over the protocol
* concurrency?
